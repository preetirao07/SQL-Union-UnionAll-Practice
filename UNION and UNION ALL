-- UNION
-- to combine rows
-- combine multiple select statements
SELECT first_name, sales FROM vancouver 
UNION
SELECT first_name, sales FROM delhi

-- 3 things to remember:
--  1. How columns are matched? (Columns are matched by the order - order of columns must be same)
--  2. No. of columns & Data type must match
--  3. Duplicates are decoupled, if wants to keep duplicates naturally, use UNION ALL function

-- Check all first_name columns from different table and union all col in one
-- also find origin of the name

select first_name, 'actor' as origin from actor
union
select first_name, 'customer' as origin from customer
order by 1 asc

select first_name, 'actor' as origin from actor
union all
select first_name, 'customer' as origin from customer
order by 1 asc

select first_name, 'actor' as origin from actor
union all
select first_name, 'customer' as origin from customer
union all
select upper(first_name), 'staff' as origin from staff
order by 2 desc
